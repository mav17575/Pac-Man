# Pac-Man
Pac-Man in Unity3D

Project has been dropped due to performance issues. OpenAI-Gym was used instead.
When this project was first started it was supposed to be the enviroment for a Reinforcement Learning Agent.
Due to a lack of knowledge at the time this project lacked the MDP structure to be efficiently used as an RL-Enviroment.
It is pretty good basis for a Pacman-Copy though.
